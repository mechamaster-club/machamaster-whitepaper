# The relationship between Mecha NFT and MCA

MCA is a necessity when casting Mecha NFT, and MCA can only be unlocked and produced through Mecha NFT pledge. The two are mutually complementary. Every time NFT is minted, the total amount of MCA will be destroyed. It drives the price up, and if you want to get more scarce MCA, you must also hold NFT to produce. The sustainable mechanism creates a virtuous spiral, bringing the best game experience and harvest to all players.
